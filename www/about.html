				<p>Sunlight Health draws its facility and supplier data from <a href="#">Medicare’s Hospital Compare database</a> and its drug information from <a href="#">Consumer Reports’ Best Buy Drugs ratings.</a> For the hospital section, we’ve used Medicare’s 30-day mortality and readmission rates, which have been cleaned up and formatted by the <a href="#">Association of Health Care Journalists (AHCJ).</a> Also included are the results of Medicare’s patient satisfaction surveys, known as HCAHPS, it’s data on hospital-acquired conditions (patients harmed in hospitals, abbreviated as “HACs”), and Medicare’s “best practice” guidelines. These guidelines, known as “process of care” datasets, cover five ailments, four of which we incorporated in the app because they’re widely used: heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia and surgical care. Using a <a href="#">methodology</a> developed with the advice of experts in the field, we’ve identified areas where hospitals are outliers – either much better or much worse at adhering to the guidelines than the national average. </p>

				<p>We limited the nursing home ratings to the most crucial indicators in Medicare’s Hospital Compare database that can be scanned quickly: staffing ratios, health inspections and the overall star rating. In addition, we included Hospital Compare’s basic quality information on home health agencies and dialysis clinics and its directory of suppliers that accept Medicare. Our prescription drug information comes directly from <a href="#">Consumer Reports’ “Best Buy Drugs” report.</a> </p>
