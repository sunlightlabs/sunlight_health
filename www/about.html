			    <p>Choosing a good hospital or nursing home can be difficult. Searching online yields conflicting
				information, and when a health matter is urgent, patients need something they can use on the go.</p>

				<p>Sunlight Health allows consumers to evaluate their health care options, from finding the right facility
				to determining the price and effectiveness of common prescription drugs. The app draws directly from
				Medicare’s Hospital Compare database -- a broad resource that covers mostly patients over 65 from
				across the socioeconomic spectrum -- for information on hospitals, nursing homes, home health care
				agencies and dialysis clinics and suppliers. We rely on the Consumers Union for their one-of-a-kind
				report on prescription drugs.</p>

				<h3>Hospitals</h3>
				<p>Before checking into the hospital, consumers can scan Sunlight Health to find out whether patients at
				that facility are much more likely than average to die of a particular ailment (or to be readmitted) within
				30 days of leaving the hospital. They can review the results of patient satisfaction surveys, and also find
				out how safe the place is: are patients developing bed sores or contracting infections at an alarming
				rate? Finally, users can see how closely each hospital follows nationally-recognized “best practices” for
				treating certain common ailments. Using a methodology (LINK) developed with the advice of experts
				in the field, we’ve identified areas where hospitals are outliers – either much better or worse than the
				average. The original numbers are there, too, for those who want to know the details.</p>

				<h3>Nursing Homes</h3>
				<p>Sunlight Health streamlines the detailed inspection results on Nursing Home Compare (LINK) so it’s easy
				for consumers to evaluate each home en route to a visit. We’ve included Medicare’s star ratings for the
				most crucial areas: staff-to-resident ratio, health inspection results, and overall score. We encourage
				anyone choosing a nursing home to review the full inspection results (LINK, NHCompare) and the
				original state health inspections, if available (LINK, NCCNHR’s page on state inspections) when you’re in
				front of a computer. In the meantime, this app serves as a quick reference that you can take along with
				you during your search.</p>

				<h3>Drugs</h3>
				<p>People without health insurance face a difficult decision when choosing prescription drugs. Consumer
				Reports has reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness, safety, dosing convenience, duration of action
				and cost of commonly-prescribed drugs and has made recommendations. Sunlight Health allows mobile
				access to this Best Buy Drugs database so patients can reference it anywhere, including at the doctor’s
				office.</p>

				<h3>Suppliers, Dialysis Clinics, Home Health Agencies</h3>
				<p>Sunlight Health also lists quality information for dialysis clinics and home health agencies around the
				country. Finally, Medicare patients looking for equipment from canes to glucose monitors can use the
				app to find the closest supplier that accepts their insurance.</p>

				<p>For more information about the Sunlight Foundation’s methodology for displaying the numbers in this
				app, check out our website (LINK).</p>
