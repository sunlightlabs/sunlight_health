			<h3> Hospitals </h3>  
				<p>Sunlight Health gives you three ways to judge the quality of your local hospital, using the latest official Medicare data.   </p>

				    <h4>Patient Surveys </h4>

				    <p>Medicare requires most hospitals to report the results of a patient satisfaction survey, designed to collect information that can be compared from hospital to hospital. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serves (CMS) adjust the numbers to account for factors like the types of patients different facilities treat and the way the tests are administered. For more information, <a href=" http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/for-professionals/patient-survey-faq.aspx?EntryID=0001">click here.</a></p>

				   <h4> Outcomes </h4>
				    <p>Using claims and enrollment data, Medicare documents how well patients with heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia fare in the month after they're admitted to the hospital. Accounting for factors like the patient's age, medical history and overall health, Medicare estimates how likely they are to die or be readmitted within 30 days. When a hospital's patients die or are readmitted much more frequently than would be expected based on their individual characteristics, the facility's rate is flagged as worse than the national average. 

				    <p>To simplify the data for consumers, we've included only the most recent year for which this information is available. (That year can vary by hospital.) For more information, <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/for-professionals/ooc/calculation-of-30-day-risk.aspx">click here.</a> </p>

				  <h4>  Care Guidelines   </h4>
				    <p>Physicians and quality experts have developed national guidelines on the best practices for treating pneumonia, <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/conditions/heartattack.aspx">heart attack</a>, <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/conditions/heartfailure.aspx">heart failure</a> and surgery patients. This section tells you how often doctors and nurses follow those guidelines. Hospitals are only judged on their performance when a given intervention makes sense for that patient. For example, if a patient is allergic to aspirin, the hospital won't get a bad mark for not giving him one. For more information on these guidelines, <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/for-consumers/poc/explainations-of-measures.aspx">click here.</a></p>

				    <p>Some hospitals receive an incentive payment for submitting this data to Medicare. The data comes from sources like administrative records and patient medical records. (For more information on how it's collected, <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov/staticpages/for-professionals/poc/data-collection.aspx.">see here.</a>  Medicare also tracks children's asthma, but we excluded it from  Sunlight Health because too few hospitals are currently participating.  </p>

				    <p>After consulting with quality experts, we've taken care to omit any data that could be misleading, and performed a couple of extra calculations to put the information into context. For each question, we've omitted the results for any hospital that, according to Medicare, had too few cases to reliably indicate performance. We also excluded any metrics that weren't very useful to consumers because the vast majority of hospitals all performed very well and very similarly to their peers: in statistical terms, cases where the mean was very high (>96%) and the standard deviation was very low (&#60;5%). When this was the case, we excluded the question entirely from the app.</p>   

				    <p>Finally, we've noted how well each hospital is doing compared to its peers. First, we calculated the average performance of all the hospitals in each local health care market. Medicare divides the country into over 3,400 of these markets, or Hospital Service Areas (HSAs), according to where most residents of a given region go to the hospital. In more isolated areas, where there's only one hospital per HSA, we've left this column out. </p>

				    <p>We also flagged any questions on which the hospital did much better or worse than the national average. In statistical terms, if a hospital's performance is more than one standard deviation from the mean, it gets a thumbs-up or thumbs-down sign <img src="css/images/outlier_down_micro.png" width="20" height="18"> <img src="css/images/outlier_up_micro.png" width="20" height="19" alt="">, marking it as an outlier on that question. If a hospital has many of these thumbs, it may be a sign that the care there is exceptionally good - or exceptionally poor. This helps users determine the difference between small variations and meaningful differences between hospitals.</p> 
			<h3>	Nursing Homes </h3>
				<p>Medicare tracks the quality of nursing homes in several ways--the strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/static/tabHelp.asp?activeTab=6">here.</a></p>
				<p>The information in Sunlight Health comes from the latest inspections, which took place within roughly the last 18 months, and comes from the following four measures:  </p> 
				   <h4> Health Inspections  </h4>
				    <p>State health officials inspect each U.S. nursing home about once every 15 months. Medicare awards each home a star rating based on how well it did on these inspections, giving more weight to the most egregious violations. Inspection results, while far from perfect, are an extremely important way to catch poor treatment at a nursing home. To see if your state maintains the actual (redacted) inspection reports on the web for anyone to read, <a href="http://www.theconsumervoice.org/sites/default/files/advocate/policy-resources/Online-Nursing-Quality-State.pdf">click here: (PDF).</a> If you find an outdated link, contact the <a href="http://www.theconsumervoice.org/contact">National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care.</a> Its guide to choosing a nursing home can be found here <a href="http://www.theconsumervoice.org/sites/default/files/advocate/A-Consumer-Guide-To-Choosing-A-Nursing-Home.pdf">(PDF).</a></p>

				  <h4>  Staffing: Overall and RN-to-patient </h4>

				    <p>Staff-to-patient ratios are another important measure of nursing home quality. Medicare collects this information and assigns each facility a star rating. These staffing levels are currently self-reported, but beginning in 2012, they'll be based on official payroll numbers - a change required by the health care reform law. We've also included the ratio of registered nurses to patients, because experts say it's another factor that can make a difference to residents. For more information about staffing levels, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Static/tabHelp.asp?language=English&activeTab=3&subTab=1">click here.</a></p>

				  <h4>  Overall Star Rating </h4>

				    <p>Medicare's overall rating for each nursing home is based on health inspections, staffing levels and a third set of questions that facilities self-report, known as "quality measures." When assigning stars, Medicare places less emphasis on these quality measures. We chose not to include them in Sunlight Health because we feel that health inspections are a more reliable and meaningful way to judge a home. For more information about how the star rating is determined, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/Static/tabHelp.asp?activeTab=6">click here.</a></p>


				<h3>Home Health and Dialysis Clinics </h3>
				<p>Our home health and dialysis information comes directly from Medicare's Compare sites.   
				The dialysis data, like the hospital outcome numbers, has been risk-adjusted according to the types of patients each facility treats. Survival information was collected from 2004 to 2007. Dialysis adequacy and hemoglobin levels, which measure how well patients' anemia was controlled, were measured in 2007. To read the fine print, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Dialysis/Static/AboutQualityMeasures.asp?dest=NAV|Home|DataDetails|AboutQualityMeasures#TabTop">click here.</a></p>

				<p>Medicare gathers two types of information on home health agencies: how often each agency gave the recommended care and what the results were. (For example, did staff check for depression at the outset? Was the patient able to walk again after being treated?) The health outcomes are adjusted according to the health status of the patient, much as Medicare does for hospitals. For details about how the data is collected and adjusted, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/HomeHealthCompare/Data/Measures/RiskAdjustment.aspx">click here.</a></p>

				<h3>Suppliers </h3>
				<p>Medicare maintains a list of businesses that carry medical supplies and accept Medicare. We've made this list searchable from your phone so that you can easily find suppliers near you. To browse through a spreadsheet of all suppliers, <a href="http://data.medicare.gov/dataset/Supplier-Directory-Data/g4vg-8tt9">click here.</a></p>

				<h3>Drugs</h3>

				<p>We used the Consumer Reports Health Best Buy Drugs™ (CRHBBD) feature for this section of the app. Consumer Reports' methodology can be found <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/health/about/best-buy-drugs.htm#abtproject">here.</a></p>
